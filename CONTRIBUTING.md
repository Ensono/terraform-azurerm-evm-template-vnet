# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue,
an email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any installed or built dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   Pull Request. Ensure also that your code is clean and production ready.
2. Update the [README.md](./README.md) with details of changes to the module, including variables, outputs
   or changes to [examples](./examples).
3. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) with a new entry block starting with `# Unreleased`
   followed by a description of your new feature, bug fix or change.
4. The CI must pass. It ensures that our Terraform module codestyle rules are followed.
5. Please wait for maintainers to review your code, they will merge and release your changes once every
   discussions or implementation details are satisfied.

### Pre-commit usage

We recommend using `pre-commit` ([the famous python git hooks tool](https://pre-commit.com/#intro))
when you start a contribution. It will automatically trigger hooks which ensure our codestyle rules are followed,
files are formatted and linted, and that your README.md file is proprerly generated and updated.

Installation is simple and works cross platform. The framework can be installed and configured with a few steps:

1. Install Python 3.0
2. Install the framework:  `pip3 install pre-commit --user`
3. Within the repo directory, run `pre-commit install` to set up the `pre-commit` git hook
4. Within the repo directory, run `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg` to set up the `commit-msg` git hook


Do your changes as usual, hooks will be triggered by `pre-commit` every time you use the `git commit` command.

To have all `pre-commit` hooks working you will have to setup thoses dependencies locally:
- [terraform](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/)
- [tfdocs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs)
- [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)


A typical workflow would be:

1. `git pull`: the most recent changes into main from remote
2. `git checkout -b [branch name]`: create a new branch to make code changes
3. `git add .`: to stage all changed files
4. `git commit -m '[commit message]'`: commit code changes, please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages
5. `git push`: push commited changes to remote

Note:
<br/>
To run the `pre-commit` hook against all files without staging them, run `pre-commit run -a`.
